```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

0.Load packages
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("janitor")
```

1. Load the `bison.csv` data.
```{r}
bison<-read_csv("data/bison.csv")
```

2. What are the dimesions and structure of the data?
```{r}
dim(bison)
str(bison)
```
```{r}
names(bison)
```

3. We are only interested in code, sex, weight, year of birth. Restrict the data to these variables and store the dataframe as a new object.
```{r}
bison_new <- select(bison, "animal_code", "animal_sex", "animal_weight", "animal_yob")
```

4. Pull out the animals born between 1980-1990.
```{r}
bison_year <- filter(bison_new, animal_yob %in% c(1980,1990))
```

5. How many male and female bison are represented between 1980-1990?
```{r}
table(bison_year$animal_sex)
```

6. Between 1980-1990, were males or females larger on average?
```{r}
bison_year_m <- filter(bison_year, animal_sex == "M")
mean(bison_year_m$animal_weight)
bison_year_f <- filter(bison_year, animal_sex == "F")
mean(bison_year_f$animal_weight)
```
