```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### 1. Plant Height Vector
```{r}
plant_height <- c(30.7, 37.6, 28.4, NA, 33.2)
```

### 2. Plant Mass Vector
```{r}
plant_mass <- c(4, 5.2, 3.7, NA, 4.6)
```

### 3. Lables for Data Matrix
```{r}
sample_name <- c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5")
measures <- c("height", "mass")
```

### 4.Building the Matrix
```{r}
plants <- c(plant_height, plant_mass)
plant_matrix <- matrix(plants, nrow=5, byrow=F)
rownames(plant_matrix) <- sample_name
colnames(plant_matrix) <- measures
plant_matrix
```

### 5. Calculating Means
```{r}
plant_means <- colMeans(plant_matrix, na.rm=T)
```

### 6.Binding the Means
```{r}
all_plant_matrix <- rbind(plant_matrix, plant_means)
all_plant_matrix
```
